QUICK FIX FOR CELL 9 ERROR:

The error is a dimension mismatch in the matrix concatenation.

Replace lines 115-117 in Cell 9 with:

# Calculate preservation metrics - FIXED
total_real_relationships = (real_count_matrix > 0).sum().sum()
total_synthetic_relationships = (synthetic_count_matrix > 0).sum().sum()
# Ensure matrices have same shape for comparison
common_index = real_count_matrix.index.intersection(synthetic_count_matrix.index)
common_columns = real_count_matrix.columns.intersection(synthetic_count_matrix.columns)
real_aligned = real_count_matrix.loc[common_index, common_columns]
synthetic_aligned = synthetic_count_matrix.loc[common_index, common_columns]
preserved_relationships = ((real_aligned > 0) & (synthetic_aligned > 0)).sum().sum()
And replace lines 122-129 with:

# Amount correlation - FIXED
real_amounts_aligned = real_amount_matrix.loc[common_index, common_columns]
synthetic_amounts_aligned = synthetic_amount_matrix.loc[common_index, common_columns]
real_amounts_flat = real_amounts_aligned.values.flatten()
synthetic_amounts_flat = synthetic_amounts_aligned.values.flatten()
amount_correlation = np.corrcoef(real_amounts_flat, synthetic_amounts_flat)[0, 1] if len(real_amounts_flat) > 1 else 0
# Count correlation - FIXED  
real_counts_flat = real_aligned.values.flatten()
synthetic_counts_flat = synthetic_aligned.values.flatten()
count_correlation = np.corrcoef(real_counts_flat, synthetic_counts_flat)[0, 1] if len(real_counts_flat) > 1 else 0
This fixes the matrix dimension mismatch causing the concatenation error.
