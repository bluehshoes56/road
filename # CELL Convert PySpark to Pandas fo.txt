EXACT CHANGES NEEDED:

Cell 1, Line 9:

# CHANGE THIS LINE:
TARGET_TRAINING_ROWS = 10000
# TO THIS:
TARGET_TRAINING_ROWS = 25000
Cell 7, Line ~15 (inside generate_conditional_synthetic_data_fixed function):

# CHANGE THIS LINE:
synthetic_batch = synthesizer.sample(num_rows=samples_per_condition)
# TO THIS:
condition_df = pd.DataFrame({conditional_column: [condition] * samples_per_condition})
synthetic_batch = synthesizer.sample(num_rows=samples_per_condition, conditions=condition_df)
Cell 7, Line ~20 (remove this line completely):

# DELETE THIS LINE:
synthetic_batch[conditional_column] = condition
That's it. Just these 3 changes:

Cell 1: Increase training rows to 25,000
Cell 7: Fix conditional generation with proper DataFrame format
Cell 7: Remove the manual condition assignment
These changes will give you proper conditional generation with 2.5x more training data for better diversity.
