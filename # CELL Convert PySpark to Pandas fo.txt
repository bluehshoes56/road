Replace lines 30-32 with:

print("\nQuick comparison:")
print(f"Original amount range: ${original_data['ed_amount'].min():.2f} - ${original_data['ed_amount'].max():.2f}")
print(f"Synthetic amount range: ${synthetic_data['ed_amount'].min():.2f} - ${synthetic_data['ed_amount'].max():.2f}")
The problem is in the f-string formatting. The current syntax has the closing brace } in the wrong position. The correct f-string format should have the formatting specification inside the braces with the expression.

Current (incorrect):

${original_data['ed_amount'].min()}:.2f}
Should be:

${original_data['ed_amount'].min():.2f}
Make these changes to lines 30-32 and the error should be resolved.
